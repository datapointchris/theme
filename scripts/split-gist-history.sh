# Split the gist's single history.jsonl into one file per machine.
#
# Usage: scripts/split-gist-history.sh [--apply]
#        (prints the split without writing unless --apply is given)
#
# Run once, from a machine whose local history holds every machine's records.
# Seeding every machine's file here — not just this one's — is the point: a
# machine that has not updated yet writes nothing under the new names, and an
# updated machine reads only those, so any machine left unseeded would vanish
# from every other machine's rankings until it updated.
#
# The pre-split history.jsonl is left in place. A machine on an older release
# still reads and writes it, and its rows arrive under the new scheme when that
# machine updates and pushes its own file for the first time.
